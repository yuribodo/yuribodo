 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 YuriBodo's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I began my programming journey as a hobby, diving into the world of Python to solve problems and create new things. The feeling of building something from scratch and seeing it work was amazing. Soon after, I took it a step further and started developing apps using React Native. It was in this process that I really delved into programming and fell in love with the field.

As I delved deeper into app development, I realized I wanted to expand my horizons and explore other facets of programming. That's when I decided to venture into web development, focusing on React. The transition wasn't easy, but every challenge I faced helped me grow and enhance my skills.

Looking back now, I see how much I've evolved since those early days of programming as just a simple hobby. What started as a solitary passion has turned into a journey of continuous learning and constant discovery. I'm excited to see where my programming journey will take me next.
